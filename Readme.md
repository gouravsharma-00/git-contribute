## 🌟 About the Project  

**Git Contribute** started with a simple thought: what if your GitHub looked active, even when you’re busy building awesome projects offline?

We all know how much recruiters love those green squares — they signal consistency, credibility, and dedication.
But sometimes, even the best developers have quiet weeks where the contribution chart looks… empty 😅

That’s where Git Contribute comes in 🎉.

With just one click, it pushes 50 random commits spread across 50 random past dates, instantly reviving your contribution graph and giving it that “always active” look.
Perfect for when you have great work to show — but your GitHub doesn’t reflect it yet.

👉 The goal? To make your GitHub look active, professional, and recruiter-ready — because let’s be honest, those green squares do get attention.
